Exploratory analysis of the Board Game Geek Community dataset. The main objective was to answer the following questions:
- What are the best rated games?
- Who are the best game designers?
- What defines a good Board Game?
- What is the influence of the difficulty level on the game's rating?
- Is there an ideal number of players that influences the game's rating?

To understand the dataset and answer these questions I did an exploratory analisys of the data, and plotted some graphics.
